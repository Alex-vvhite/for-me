# About Me
I am 20 years old, I am studying.
I was previously interested in creating sites from pure 0, so I chose this direction. At the university, the bias is more on the visual component, but I want to write the site's functionality. Friends suggested your course, which immediately looked different from others. I am sure I will be able to gain experience and create my first works together with your unique method of leading students.
# Skills
* html

* JavaScript (Fundamentals)

# Code Examples

function printerError(s) {

  const alphabet = 'abcdefghijklm'
  for(let sel of s.split('')){
    x+=1
   for(let sell of alphabet){
          if(sell===sel){
            prov+=1
          }
    }
  }
  y = x-prov
  
  const result = `${y}/${x}`
  return result
